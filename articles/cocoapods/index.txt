Use CocoaPods Dependencies in RubyMotion Apps
=============================================
Laurent Sansonetti <lrz@hipbyte.com>

In this article we will cover how you can integrate the http://cocoapods.org[CocoaPods] dependency manager inside your RubyMotion project.

Synopsis
--------

CocoaPods is the missing dependency manager for Objective-C projects. It is similar to RubyGems but for Objective-C dependencies.

Dependencies in CocoaPods are called Pods. You can get the list of Pods available from the http://github.com/CocoaPods/Specs[CocoaPods/Specs] GitHub repository.

CocoaPods was originally designed to be integrated in Objective-C Xcode projects, but we worked with the awesome CocoaPods author to make it possible to be used in RubyMotion projects.

You can check the http://cocoapods.org website to get more information about CocoaPods.

Installation
------------

First, you will need to install and setup CocoaPods, unless you already have.

----
$ sudo gem install cocoapods
$ pod setup
----

The RubyMotion CocoaPods integration also comes as a gem. 

----
$ sudo gem install motion-cocoapods
----

The code lives in the http://github.com/HipByte/motion-cocoapods[HipByte/motion-cocoapods] GitHub repository.

Usage
-----

You will need to require the gem inside the 'Rakefile' of your project.

----
require 'motion-cocoapods'
----

Once you do that, you can simply use the +pods+ method of the application configuration object to describe the Pods you want to require, by using the same expressions as you would do in a regular Podfile.

For instance, if you want to require the +JSONKit+ Pod.

----
Motion::Project::App.setup do |app|
  # ...
  app.pods do
    pod 'JSONKit'
  end
end
----

That's all you have to do.

The next time you build your project, the +JSONKit+ sources will be downloaded then built and linked against your application executable. If you require a Pod that has dependencies, they will also be properly honored.
